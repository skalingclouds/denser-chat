Main features:

* Extract text and tables from PDFs.
* Build a chatbot with [denser-retriever](https://github.com/denser-org/denser-retriever)
* Support interactive Streamlit chatbot app with source highlighted in the PDF

## Installation

First clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/denser-org/denser-chat.git
```

Go to the project directory and start a virtual environment. Make sure your python version is 3.11.

```bash
cd denser-chat
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Run the following command to install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or use this [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) command

```bash
poetry install
```

## Quick Start

Before building an index, we need to run docker-compose to start Elasticsearch and Milvus services in the background,
which are required for denser-retriever.

```bash
cd denser_chat
docker compose up -d
```

We run the following command to build a chatbot index, where the first argument is the pdf files (two here), the second
argument is the output directory, and the third argument is the index name.

```bash
python build.py ../examples/dpr.pdf ../examples/ti.pdf output test_index
```

This command will build an index `test_index` via denser-retriever. Next we can start a streamlit app with the following
command. As the app relies on ChatGPT or Claude API, we need to set their keys (one is sufficient) in the environment variables.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="your-claude-key"
streamlit run demo.py -- --index_name test_index
```

Then you can start to ask questions such as "What is in-batch negative sampling ?" or "what parts have stop pins?". You can expect that the chatbot will return the answer with the source highlighted in the PDF.
